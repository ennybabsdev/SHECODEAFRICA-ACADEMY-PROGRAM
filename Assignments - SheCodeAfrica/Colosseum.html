            Colosseum, giant amphitheater built in Rome under the Flavian emperors. Construction of the Colosseum was begun sometime between 70 and 72 CE during the reign of Vespasian. It is located just east of the Palatine Hill, on the grounds of what was Nero’s Golden House. 
            The artificial lake that was the centerpiece of that palace complex was drained, and the Colosseum was sited there, a decision that was as much symbolic as it was practical. Vespasian, whose path to the throne had relatively humble beginnings, chose to replace the tyrannical emperor’s private lake with a public amphitheater that could host tens of thousands of Romans.
            As one of the few mostly intact structures from the Roman Empire, the Colosseum stands today as a monument to ancient Rome’s architectural and engineering prowess. It is also a major source of tourism revenue for the Italian government. In 2018 the Colosseum, Roman Forum, and Palatine Hill together brought in more than $63.3 million (€53.8 million), the highest revenue of any tourist attraction in Italy.
